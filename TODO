Optional:
- Animate scrolling focused box into view
- A better way to save the changes
- Indicate which boxes have been changed
- Store lists Box objects, rather than constantly packing/unpacking
- Scroll <textarea> selection into view
- Show instructions in place of image on initial load.
- The split select box should immediately lose focus. (type after split = disaster)
- May have some off-by-one issues in where box borders are displayed.
- Add a keyboard shortcut for split N ways (alt-2 = split 2)
- Add a delete button
- Bug where all letters go to the bottom in Safari (NaN issue?)
- Indicate what the file names are when loaded via drag/drop
- Add a "merge" buttonâ€”if nothing else, it's "undo split".
